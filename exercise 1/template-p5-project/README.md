## TIK TAK TOE 

** this is the tik tak toe game i was able to create. I was only able to get this far as my head can't comprehend how to create different players that take turns without looking up a tutorial. The way it works is that if the mouse is clicked in one of the square, it will display an X in the location of the square. (which would be player 1s turn), at the same time, an O will display on the board, (which would be the players 2 (computer) turn.) I wanted it to go on until the board is full or there is a winner but, couldn't figure out how to create an if statement for the middle squares. **
