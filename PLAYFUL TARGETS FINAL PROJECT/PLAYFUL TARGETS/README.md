# Playful Interaction - Touch the Targets
##### Frederik, Tania. April 2023 

![first screen the player encounters in the game](assets/images/homescreen.jpg)


We intend to make a sort of dancing game using the camera that has a person wave at targets on the screen as quick as possible to complete the moves in a record time.  

In the end, the camera and color detection proved too unreliable for us to do something reliable with them, so we settled for a "touch the targets" on the screen type game, instead of with the camera as the input device. The intended audience is just about anybody. The one second time frame to touch the targets feels short enough to be challenging, but long enough to be approachable by a wide variety of players. 

Tania did make use of color tracking in a smaller format, in the play function, to generate a filter for the displayed camera image. In the end, this shift in use of the color finding ability of p5 served our final vision better without making us completely discard the camera or color detection.

## Progress notes

Tania figured out reversing the camera image so movement in front of it is intuitive
We have both independently figured out color tracking on the camera
We intend to have 2 targets appear alternatively for our playtest
Done, 2 targets appear alteratively when the color being searched for appears around them

Questions i have and need to figure out : 

Will an ascii filter would slow down the game or maybe crash it ?

Can we implement color tracking inside of an ascii filter ?

Should we do ascii targets also ? 

Im having a lot of trouble regarding the sizing of the webcam - canvas - filter ... will have to play around with that. 

I've (Fred) tried it all, and finally got the text to work in my logic file but things are still laggy when the code is merged, i must've missed something, but time is up


### to dos (in no particular order)

we need to figure out how the color detection will work with the ASCII filter, given that such a filter turns everything to B&W. maybe the filter is activated when we calibrate with mouse click/ when we press a key, and the p5 color tracks the colored image, but we only see the filtered image
commenting the code on color tracking in a concise fashion (I, Fred, will rewatch the tutorial on color Tracking and use it to comment the code better)
commenting the code on flipping the camera feed
locking exposure of webcam/ finding & using camera that can have its exposure locked
leaderboard: need to have a global timer that starts when the game is started with a key press, ends when the last target is hit, and stores said time in an array only if the time is lesser than the lowest time (lowest value) already in the array, and display five times. thus, the highest time is booted out of the array if it is higher than all other five times 

timer
targets appear on screen and disappear when "hit" (do with OOT)
title screen
sfx
another idea: when a target appears, theres a timer that starts (not shown to the player) and depending on how long it takes for the player to "touch" the target, text appears and disappear real quick, saying either "GREAT!" or "MISS..." like those rhythm games where the game gives you feedback on the timing of your inputs with little text like that.

Also, it would be interesting and satisfying to maybe add some sounds or music in some sort since it is a game so that we could give some dopamine reward to the player in the game. Maybe creating some sounds with oscillators etc .. 

I would maybe like for the targets to appear as small little points, ( particle systems maybe)  or that the target is actually made of the ascii symbols but that a given region become of a certain other color and shape ( lets say a red circle )  when the curser goes on it ( the player hand movement ), it collides with it and makes the ascii target collide,  explode  a little and disappear so that it then reappears a second later to it's initial default font and color 


## Installation

no install needed, just click play, and then press any key to begin!


## Run

The code runs on a local server, as of now we only need a webcam and we would need to figure out color detection. We thought about using a kinect, but we wanted to try and see if we could do it on webcam first before going on to make it more complex, for our level of knowledge.  

the hit detection did break somewhat during the merge and i (Fred) cannot repair it again (both out of time and patience) but the logic in the logic sketch showcases how it should run better

## Future iterations

What do you hope to add in the future and what did you not have time for? 

I (Tania) would like for the targets to appear as small little points, ( particle systems maybe)  or that the target is actually made of the ascii symbols but that a given region become of a certain other color and shape ( lets say a red circle )  when the curser goes on it ( the player hand movement ), it collides with it and makes the ascii target collide,  explode  a little and disappear so that it then reappears a second later to it's initial default font and color 

Obviously, we want to test out the target detection with the camera and color detection, as was originally intended. We think a camera with locked exposure would be a good starting point for that

We wanted particle effects but ran out of time as well.

Wanted to, using keycodes, set keys to start and reset the game. one key sets keytostart to 0, thus when it turns to 1 again the whole code runs back from the beginning

Wanted to map the alpha value of the text notificatons to the y position, so that as it rises, it fades out

Would love to add more to the background, complexify the filter, add more sound effects and mostly spice up the gameplay with extra challenges. maybe a power up that slows down the apparition of targets, or maybe targets that flee the mouse when they appear for a certain time. 
Leaning into the premise of the game harder is really what we regret not having the time for.

What is there to want but more? That being said, this will have to suffice for now. i, Fred, am pretty proud of what we accomplished here, especially given my lack of experience, this has been tough, but i've learned a lot about OOP and how to organize projects so as to have them be more easily edited and corrected. This course has set me on a path of learning for coding and i cant wait to get back to more personal projects in my free time!

### Sketches, ideas

Here is one example of an Ascii portrait I (Tania) made in the console which i would like to use as a filter, inspiration for the project:

Found a cool minigame that includes multiples games on it, such as a press the target one one. Here is the link !

## Credits, resources, etc 
We used a tutorial on color tracking from Youtube, to get some webcam tracking. CP2: Object Detection â€“ Webcam Tracking in p5.js/TensorFlow! From jeff Thompson. 
As for AScii aesthetic I am currently exploring and experimenting with the aid of the coding train's tutorial by Daniel Shiffman which is the coding challenge 166 ; Ascii text images. 


#### Notes on code comments and documentation

Documentation is a critical part of writing code. It is for you, but also for others you might want to share your code with. If you have ever used code written by someone else, think about what they could have done to help you understand it better. If you're proud of your code, documenting it can help others learn.

Imagine: its 2 years from now and you've completely forgotten what you wrote, and your gallery show has to be installed tomorrow. Your code almost works, but you can't remember what you wrote. What might help you make changes quickly and remember what you write?

- Always comment your code. Add your name and project title in the main code file.  
- Every function should be named described clearly according to what they do.  
- All variables should have clear and reasonable names that describe what they do. 
- Sections of code that make decisions or perform complex tasks should be described clearly in comments.  
- Sections of code borrowed from other places should be cited and linked.  
- Old code should be removed!  
- Make your readme file clear and readable.
